# Overview

This is a brute feed parser.

Reasons:

 - feedparser does not parse everything. Had to manually parse something
 - does not parse CDATA correctly (at least what I remember it did not work)
 - there were some problems with using it in threads (async functions

# Standards? What standards?

This project does not care about standards, feeds. We use brute force attack. Read whatever we can, however we can.
